## Games in the Arcade:

- **Snake 🐍:** Navigate the snake across the screen, trying to eat the apples without running into walls or yourself.
- **Minesweeper 💣:** Clear the minefield without detonating a mine, using numbers to deduce where mines are hidden.
- **Hangman 🖋️:** Guess the hidden word one letter at a time, but be careful - each wrong guess brings the hangman closer to his fate.
- **Emoji Match Game 😃:** A memory game where you turn over cards two at a time, trying to match pairs of emojis.
